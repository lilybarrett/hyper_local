[HyperLocal](https://hyper-local.herokuapp.com/) is a Rails app connecting people with local volunteer opportunities. I based my app on the idea that, in order to make a large impact -- whether you care deeply about climate change, women's issues, or health care access -- you can start small.

For HyperLocal, I've done the following:

- built two different interfaces, one for volunteers and one for organizations
- constructed complex database relationships with PostgreSQL
- incorporated the Google Maps API
- enhanced the user experience on the front-end with the Foundation framework and the Animate.css library
